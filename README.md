Natural language → Intent DAG judgment compiler
# RIS Compiler Unified v1.2

Natural language → Intent DAG judgment compiler.

RIS Compiler transforms ambiguous human intent into a structured, executable decision graph.  
It does not decide. It clarifies.

---

## Purpose

Human judgment is often vague, emotionally loaded, and structurally incomplete.  
RIS Compiler restructures that ambiguity into a minimal, explicit decision model.

The goal is not optimization.  
The goal is clarity, reversibility, and responsibility.

---

## Core Functions

1. Ambiguity scoring  
2. Mode detection  
3. Intent DAG generation (3–8 nodes)  
4. Discretion boundary clarification  
5. Prompt compilation for downstream execution  

---

## Design Principles

- Human retains decision ownership  
- AI structures, never overrides  
- Reversibility is prioritized over maximization  
- Minimal sufficient structure (RIS-0 mindset)  

---

## Output Philosophy

Instead of answering directly, the compiler:

- Extracts intent
- Maps causal structure
- Defines responsibility boundaries
- Produces an executable prompt

The output is compact, structured, and operational.

---

## Status

Prompt-based architecture.  
Designed for integration with local LLM systems or external high-capability models.
